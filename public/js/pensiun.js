// This file is intentionally left empty as the JavaScript functionality
// is directly included in the Blade template's script section.
// This is to maintain the ability to access Laravel's Blade variables
// and routes directly in the script.
// 
// For a production application, you might want to move common
// functionality here and pass necessary data via data attributes
// or a dedicated API endpoint.
